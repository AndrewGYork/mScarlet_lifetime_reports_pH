<h4 id="yeast_screen_text">Yeast screen to identify promising low pH biosensors</h4>

<p>In order to identify a viable target for a FLIM-based low pH sensor, we expressed several fluorescent proteins (<a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mscarlet/">mScarlet</a>,

in BY4741 S. cerevisiae from a p416-GPD-FP-CYC1 plasmid (data not shown).  After overnight growth at 30°C with shaking in 10 mls of synthetic media without uracil, yeast were spun down and resuspended in water. We diluted the yeast in a 1:10 ratio in Carmody buffer + 0.1% digitonin, pH 3 to 12 in 0.5 pH unit intervals, and measured the lifetime as a function of pH. We decided to characterize mScarlet further due to its large lifetime change and bright fluorescence. </p>

<h4 id="glycerol_text">Dependence of mScarlet lifetime on glycerol concentration</h4>

<p>We observe a slight decrease in fluorescence lifetime at high glycerol concentrations (<a href="#mscarlet_glycerol_header" target="_self">Fig S5</a>), which is likely attributable to an increase in refractive index. As predicted by the Strickler-Berg equation for fluorescence lifetime

[<a class="citation" href="http://doi.org/10.1063/1.1733166" title="Relationship between Absorption Intensity and Fluorescence Lifetime of Molecules; S. J. Strickler, Robert A. Berg; Journal of Chemical Physics 37, 4, 814-822 (1962)">Strickler 1962</a>],

we observe quadratic dependence on the refractive index (RI) of the surrounding medium in a series of glycerol solutions. Although the viscosity of the glycerol-water solution is also changing, we do not observe a clear relationship between viscosity and lifetime, suggesting that the lifetime is responding to the RI change rather than the viscosity change. We note that, because of the fundamental nature of the relationship between fluorescence and RI, <strong>all</strong> fluorescence-based pHlys readouts will display sensitivity to RI. Therefore, although the RI sensitivity is weak relative to the pH sensitivity, caution should be used in interpreting optical pHlys measurements when the lysosomal RI may be changing.</p>

<h4 id="in_vitro_vs_cells_text">Differences between mScarlet lifetimes observed in lysosomes and in pure protein</h4>

<p>We observe various differences in the pH-lifetime calibration curve between lysosomally targeted mScarlet and pure mScarlet in vitro. First, the pKa is shifted by 0.5 pH units (5.0 in cells and 5.5 in vitro). Second, the lifetimes we measure are approximately 0.2 ns lower in cells than in pure protein (i.e. the entire curve is shifted vertically down in lifetime). We speculate that the fusion of mScarlet to LAMP1 is responsible for the pKa shift, but purification of the mScarlet-LAMP1 construct to validate this is impractical. It is also likely that the local RI that mScarlet experiences affects its lifetime

[<a class="citation" href="http://doi.org/10.1063/1.1733166" title="Relationship between Absorption Intensity and Fluorescence Lifetime of Molecules; S. J. Strickler, Robert A. Berg; Journal of Chemical Physics 37, 4, 814-822 (1962)">Strickler 1962</a>],

and the local RI adjacent to a lipid bilayer is almost certainly different from that of PBS. Indeed, changes in the GFP fluorescence lifetime have been observed when it is expressed in the cytosol or tethered to a membrane

and a similar shift in lifetime was observed between free and membrane-tethered RpHluorin2

Regardless of the origin of these differences, we believe that they do not pose a problem for the use of mScarlet as a pH indicator, as we obtain consistent results within each sample type.</p>

  U2OS cells were transiently transfected with the pHlys reporter pHLARE8 and treated with 100 nM BafA for 5 hours. Point-scanning confocal micrographs of the mCherry and sfGFP channels reveal a range of costaining patterns for the two fluorescent proteins in pHLARE. While the mCherry signal generally appears as a hollow outline (cytosolic side of lysosomal membrane), the sfGFP signal (lumenal side of lysosomal membrane) appears as a filled circle in some lysosomes and a hollow circle in others. In the filled circles, sfGFP signal in the center of the lysosome appears far away from the mCherry stain, likely representing cleavage of the sfGFP from LAMP1 by lysosomal proteases. White arrows indicate clear examples of the various co-staining patterns (top two arrows, hollow; bottom two arrows, filled).

<h3 id="purity_characterization">Characterization of purity of 6xHis-mScarlet preparation</h3>
<p>6xHis-mScarlet was purified as described in the Methods. Below, SDS-Page of purified mScarlet protein, showing a major band at 28 kDa, along with fragments at 19 kDa and 9 kDa indicating cleavage of the backbone under reducing conditions (see <a href="./index.html#mscarlet_purification">Methods</a>). Protein was 99.5% pure by UV in analytical high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC).</p>
