A scientific publication that describes a new approach for measuring lysosomal pH, based on the fluorescence lifetime of mScarlet. This repository hosts everything you need to reproduce our results. Read the publication here: https://jlazzaridean.github.io/mScarlet_pHlys (hosted via Julia Lazzari-Dean's personal GitHub account) or here: https://andrewgyork.github.io/mScarlet_pHlys (hosted via Andrew G. York's personal GitHub account)

This repository is intended to hold a (mostly) self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, CSS, and small images (`index.html`, `appendix.html`, and the `javascript`, `stylesheets`, `figures` and `images` directories)
* A (limited) PDF version of the publication; note that this does not include animated/interactive figures.
* Code which produces figures (in the `figures` directory). You can run and modify this code to verify and explore our results. See `figure_generation/README.txt` for instructions how to run the figure generation code.

Some files aren't suitable for version control, (e.g. raw data, minimally pre-processed data, etc). These are stored in a dedicated repository:
* Source data https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6115684

Hopefully this makes it easier to manage big, non-text files without risking the faithful version control of small, important text-based files stored here.
