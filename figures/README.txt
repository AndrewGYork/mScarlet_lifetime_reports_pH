Note that the raw data to generate these figures is located in a separate zenodo repository

To get the relative paths to work in the figure generation code, you must first download the "source data" zip, unzip it, and place the "source_data" folder in the same parent directory as the "figures" directory.

In general, the workflow used to generate these figures is the following:
Raw data are in the source_data folder, along with some low-level data processing scripts (conversion of photon arrival times to lifetimes per pixel, image segmentation). The output from these processing scripts are also in the raw data folder.
For some of the data, there are mid-level scripts that are also with the raw data, which calculate parameters for each segmented region of interest (i.e. per lysosome) and use pandas to make a table of lifetimes and metadata for each. These tables are then saved to csv and located in the source_data folder.

The scripts in the figures folder generally read .csvs generated by processing scripts in the source_data folder to create plots. They sometimes (but infrequently) access the source images directly. Images that are displayed in the figures are generally duplicated into the figure folders for easy access, although they are also stored in the source data folder.

Individual .py files that make figures usually generate figure panels (individual plots). For multi-panel main text figures, these panels are then assembled with Adobe Illustrator into the final figure.
