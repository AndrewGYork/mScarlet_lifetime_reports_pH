Note that the raw data to generate these figures is located in a separate zenodo repository
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6115684

To get the relative paths to work in the figure generation code, you must first download the "source data" zip, unzip it, and place the "source_data" folder in the same parent directory as the "figures" directory.
