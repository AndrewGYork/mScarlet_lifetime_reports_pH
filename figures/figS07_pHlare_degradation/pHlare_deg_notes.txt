Note that these data from 2021-02-18 seem to be some of the only high quality baf-DMSO data I took with pHlare.

Goal is to show that the red and green do not always stay colocalized. This is easiest to see in baf data, where green is brighter and lysosomes are enlarged, but I suspect it happens on other cases too.

The discrepancy between two hollow circles and a hollow circle and a filled circle can be seen relatively clearly in image 04-4, but some combination of the baf images will probably be required to make this point.

The image in the figure is 04-4
I scaled both channels to 500 counts max and then converted to 8 bit.
I then scaled the green channel from 0-85 and the red channel from 0-61 and exported to png (both as a composite and the individual frames, scaled the same).
The image shown in illustrator is a crop of this larger image.
